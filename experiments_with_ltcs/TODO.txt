       RERUN AL INFERENCE ON BEST EPOCH

        


running ALL 10-2
running FUTURE LOSS 10-0 

redo 1604 1603 best//last with 5 history   DONE

redo all above 1808 best

evaluate 1907 again
enter 1811 resulst

export the results as images
crop the images
paste into a new powerpoint
rerunning all models

TO DO :

handle the fact that the realtime data does not have laser data
and therefore this is not normalised
